Library. The Boost Graph Library is available as a part of the Boost
libraries. Other important links:

Build & Install
---------------

The section describes how to build, install, and test the BGL-Python
bindings.


Prebuilt binaries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Prebuild binaries might already be available for your
platform on the BGL-Python web site at:

  http://www.osl.iu.edu/~dgregor/bgl-python/


Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  - A very modern C++ compiler. We have tested with GNU C++ versions
    3.3 and newer and Microsoft Visual C++ 7.1 and newer. 

  - Boost 1.33.1 (beta) or newer: Get the source from 

      http://sourceforge.net/projects/boost

  - Python 2.2 or newer. Be sure that the Python headers are
    installed!

Once we have met the prerequisites, extract the Boost distribution
into some directory that we will refer to as BOOST_ROOT.


Boost.Jam
~~~~~~~~~

We use the Boost.Build system to build the Python bindings for the
BGL. The "Preparation" section at the following web page describes
how to build Boost.Jam, which is the core of the build system:

  http://www.boost.org/more/getting_started.html#Preparation

However, most users can just enter the directory 

  $BOOST_ROOT/tools/build/jam_src

and run either build.sh (for Unix-like systems) or build.bat (for
Windows). Copy the "bjam" executable from this step some place
convenient: we'll be using it to build the Python bindings.


Python Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The BGL-Python bindings use the excellent Boost.Python library to
reflect the C++ data structures and algorithms into Python. Although
we build the Boost.Python library automatically, you may still need
to follow the configuration advice here:

  http://www.boost.org/libs/python/doc/building.html

Most likely, you will only need to set the PYTHON_VERSION to your
Python version. However, the page explains all of the configuration
options that might be needed.


Build
~~~~~

Once you have determined which Boost.Jam options you will need, change
to the top-level BGL-Python directory (bgl-python-0.9) and run bjam:

   bjam <options>

Once the build has completed, the "python" subdirectory contains the
BGL-Python package. In the "python" subdirectory there will be a file
"libboostpython.EXT" (EXT is the extension used for shared libraries
on your platform). You should copy that file some place where your
dynamic linker can find it.


Testing
~~~~~~~

To test the BGL-Python package, enter the "python" subdirectory and
start a Python interpreter. In the interpreter, enter:

      import boost.graph

If the command executes properly, you're all set! See the example
subdirectory for some usage examples, and have fun!


Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Although we do not have an automated installation procedure at this
time, once the build has succeeded the "python" subdirectory is a
standalone Python package for the BGL-Python bindings. You may copy
the contents of the "python" subdirectory anywhere within your
PYTHONPATH. 

------------
Getting Help
------------

The Python interface to the BGL contains extensive on-line help. Use
the help() command in Python or pydoc to view help for any of the
components or algorithms of the BGL. If you are still having trouble,
feel free to contact us via the Boost-Users or Boost mailing lists at:

  http://www.boost.org/more/mailing_lists.htm

Or, you may e-mail one of the authors directly for more assistance.
