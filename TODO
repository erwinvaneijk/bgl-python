Items to be completed before BGL-Python 1.0:
  - Make vertex/edge descriptors work properly in Python dicts, either
  with caching or __hash__ tricks.

  - Make write_graphviz take a file descriptor instead of a file name

  - pybgl-like property injection into vertex and edge descriptors,
    e.g. for e in g.edges: e.weight = random()

  - Provide wrappers for all of the algorithms in the BGL

  - Push changes made to the BGL in the BGL-Python bindings back into
    the main Boost tree

Items to be completed "in the future":
  - Subgraph support
  - Vertex/edge filtering
  - Easy display of graphs
