# This file builds the Python bindings for the Parallel BGL. Because
# we currently have no support for MPI in Boost.Build (for now), one
# needs to perform some serious hackery to get things to build. For
# GCC builds, we need to replace the name of the GCC C and C++
# compilers with the MPI versions, e.g.,
#
#   bjam -sGCC=mpicc -sGXX=mpic++
#
# In the future, we hope to do real detection of the underlying MPI so
# just linking against the Boost MPI library will pull in the
# appropriate linking commands.
